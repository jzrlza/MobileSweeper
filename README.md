## Acknowledgments

* Inspiration - From playing the mobile game called [Minesweeper Collector](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.griffgriffgames.minesweeper&hl=en), where there are lots of challenging minesweeper puzzles, in which I owned a premium account after I became an intermediate player for a while and wanted to be an expert player, at first I have trouble visioning the mines analysis so I have to come up with this.
